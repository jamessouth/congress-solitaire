[Congress](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_(card_game)>) solitaire card game for my DSA class. Many versions of solitaire use a last-in, first-out card pile; in computer science we call this a stack. This version has nine of them!

The card images are in the public domain and are from a [French-suited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-suited_playing_cards) deck of cards called "Tarot Allemand" by BP Grimaud, Paris, France, 1898. Compared to standard 52-card decks, [tarot decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot) have 26 additional cards (the Fool, four Knights, and a suit of 21 trump cards), but they are not used here. Additionally, instead of aces there are just "one" cards. Images downloaded from [Biblioth√®que nationale de France.](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10510159t)
